# Bench — live test log

The checklist from DESIGN.md. ✅ is seen working live, ⏳ is not tried yet
(listed with why), and ❌ is broken.

## 2026-09-28, first launch (Bench 0.1.0, Claude Science 0.1.54)

- ✅ **Signs in on first launch.** The daemon was already running, a nonce
  link was loaded, and the projects, sidebar and composer showed.
- ✅ **No Safari tab opened** at launch (nothing in Bench can reach Safari
  except the Browser window's "Open in Safari" button, per a code review of
  Routing.swift).
- ✅ **Find (⌘F).** The bar appears and highlights matches ("ready"). Caveat:
  it took keystrokes the user was typing into the page. Opening it should
  only happen on ⌘F, which it does; but check that closing it returns focus
  to the page.
- ✅ **Idle cost.** The Bench process is at 0.0% CPU and 49 MB with the
  window open. The page itself runs in WebKit's helper processes.
- ✅ **The user is working in it** (a session typed and sent in Bench).
- ⏳ **Waiting on Sam** (these touch real data or need his permission
  prompts):
  - file upload (single, multiple, folder)
  - dragging files into the page
  - downloads
  - microphone (the macOS prompt)
  - connector OAuth pop-up
  - pop-out windows
  - HTML preview
  - confirm dialogs (e.g. deleting a test session)
- ⏳ **Lab panel, needs-input card and finished card:** need a session that
  works, then waits or finishes.
- ⏳ **Claude Science desktop notifications:** need its desktop
  notifications switched on in its own settings.
- ⏳ **External link to the in-app Browser window, zoom, back/forward, and
  closing and reopening the window:** not tried while the user was typing.
